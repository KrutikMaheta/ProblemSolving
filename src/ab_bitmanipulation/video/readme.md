|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Check Bit | Checks if a specific bit is set in a number. | 10, 2 | false | 1. Bitwise AND the number with 1 left-shifted by the bit position. 2. Check if the result is non-zero. | O(1) | O(1) | A_BitOps.java | Bit Manipulation |
| Set Bit | Sets a specific bit in a number to 1. | 32, 1 | 34 | 1. Bitwise OR the number with 1 left-shifted by the bit position. | O(1) | O(1) | A_BitOps.java | Bit Manipulation |
| Toggle Bit | Toggles the value of a specific bit in a number. | 32, 5 | 64 | 1. Bitwise XOR the number with 1 left-shifted by the bit position. | O(1) | O(1) | A_BitOps.java | Bit Manipulation |
| Clearing Bit | Clears a specific bit in a number (sets it to 0). | 7, 1 | 6 | 1. Bitwise AND the number with the complement of 1 left-shifted by the bit position. | O(1) | O(1) | A_BitOps.java | Bit Manipulation |
| Number in Pair Except One | Finds the single number that appears only once in an array where all other numbers appear twice. | \ | 3 | 1. XOR all the numbers in the array. 2. The result is the single number. | O(n) | O(1) | B_NumberInPairExceptOne.java | Bit Manipulation |
| Number in Pair Except Two | Finds the two numbers that appear only once in an array where all other numbers appear twice. | \ | 5, 7 | 1. XOR all the numbers in the array. 2. Find the first set bit in the XOR result. 3. XOR all numbers where the corresponding bit is set, and all numbers where it's not set. 4. The two results are the two numbers. | O(n) | O(1) | C_NumberInPairExceptTwo.java | Bit Manipulation |
| Pair with Minimum XOR | Finds the pair of numbers in an array with the minimum XOR value. | \ | 1, 2 | 1. Sort the array. 2. XOR adjacent pairs and find the minimum XOR. | O(n log n) | O(1) | D_PairWithMinXOR.java | Bit Manipulation |
| No of Set Bits | Counts the number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of an integer. | 38 | 3 | **Approach 1:** 1. Iterate through the bits of the number using the right shift (>>) operator. 2. Count the number of 1s encountered. **Approach 2:** 1. Iterate through the bits of the number using `n & (n - 1)` to clear the rightmost set bit in each iteration. 2. Count the number of iterations. | O(log n) | O(1) | E_NoOfSetBits.java | Bit Manipulation |
